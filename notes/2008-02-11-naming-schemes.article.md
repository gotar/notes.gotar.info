Garrett Murray writes about [his history with naming schemes](http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/26015986) for hardware and networks.

My favourite scheme so far was in one of my former offices, where we named everything after Street Fighter characters. A few of the notable names:

- _ehonda_ was the network file server - big, fat and full of data
- _guile_ was the backup server - being a millitary man, he [covered our six](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=watch+my+six)
- _blanka_ - courtesy of his electric shock powers - was the firewall
- _vega_ was my workstation, because I could speak Spanish

Another benefit of the scheme was that, given the proliferation of Street Fighter sequels, it was unlikely we were going to run out of names very quickly. The scheme I use at home is characters from [Azumanga Daioh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azumanga_Daioh). My iMac is Chiyo, and a rarely leave home without Tadakichi-san, my MacBook.
