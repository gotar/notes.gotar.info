The second Canberra Ruby Crew meeting was a success. Our number grew to seven, and all had a good time chatting, eating, playing guitar hero and sharing ideas and code. Thanks to everyone who came along.

Some things we did:

- [Hugh](http://hughevans.net/) introduced some of the crew to the wonders of [Haml and Sass](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/) and bringing them together with [StaticMatic](http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/)
- [Shoaib](http://rails.nomad-labs.com/) ran us through how to get started with [git](http://git.or.cz/) and [gitorious](http://gitorious.org/)
- [Matt](allen.com.au) showed off his use of the [Stencil](http://stencil.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/) plugin and his rocking [Open Flash Charts](http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/).

The next meeting will be on Friday the 21st of March. Keep your eyes on the [Rails Oceania google group](http://groups.google.com/group/rails-oceania/) for an announcement closer to the date!

**Edit:** The next meeting will actualy be on Friday 28th March, beginning a last-Friday-of-the-month pattern.
