<p>ActiveSupport's Hash.from_xml class method makes this a piece of cake. Instead of testing against the XML as a string or parsing it manually, you can turn it into a hash and get directly to the attribute you want. Behold:</p>
<pre><code>describe Product do
  before(:each) do
    @product = Product.new
  end

  # net_price is the custom attribute I have added to the XML serialisation
  it &quot;should include net price in XML serialisation&quot; do
    @product.attributes = valid_product_attributes
    Hash.from_xml(@product.to_xml)['product']['net_price'].should == @product.net_price
  end
end
</code></pre>
