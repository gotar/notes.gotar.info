<p>My favourite scheme so far was in one of my former offices, where we named everything after Street Fighter characters. A few of the notable names:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ehonda</em> was the network file server - big, fat and full of data</li>
<li><em>guile</em> was the backup server - being a millitary man, he <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=watch+my+six">covered our six</a></li>
<li><em>blanka</em> - courtesy of his electric shock powers - was the firewall</li>
<li><em>vega</em> was my workstation, because I could speak Spanish</li>
</ul>
<p>Another benefit of the scheme was that, given the proliferation of Street Fighter sequels, it was unlikely we were going to run out of names very quickly. The scheme I use at home is characters from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azumanga_Daioh">Azumanga Daioh</a>. My iMac is Chiyo, and a rarely leave home without Tadakichi-san, my MacBook.</p>
